# ESXi 6.7 on NUC8i7BEH (with Ubuntu 20.04 in VMware Workstation Pro 16)

## Build Procedure

Although this setup uses Ubuntu 20.04 guest OS in VMware, the same should apply to native OS running bare metal.

### Prerequisites

#### Ubuntu Environment Configurations

Note that all the commands in this subsection should be executed on the **Ubuntu** machine.

1. Before starting building the lab, updating the system is recommended. This can be done by executing `sudo apt update` and then `sudo apt full-upgrade --yes`. Finally, `reboot` the machine.

2. Install necessary tools by executing the following command.

   ```shell
   sudo apt install build-essential curl git python3-pip gnupg software-properties-common
   ```

   After that, you may want to add `~/.local/bin` to the `PATH` variable to access tools installed by `pip3` by the following command.

   ```shell
   echo 'export PATH="$PATH:~/.local/bin"' >> ~/.bashrc
   ```

3. Install *Terraform* by executing the following commands. Find more on [the official website](https://www.terraform.io/downloads).

   ```shell
   curl -fsSL https://apt.releases.hashicorp.com/gpg | sudo apt-key add -
   sudo apt-add-repository "deb [arch=amd64] https://apt.releases.hashicorp.com $(lsb_release -cs) main"
   sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install terraform
   ```

4. Install *Vagrant* by executing the following commands. Find more on [the official website](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads).

   ```shell
   curl -fsSL https://apt.releases.hashicorp.com/gpg | sudo apt-key add -
   sudo apt-add-repository "deb [arch=amd64] https://apt.releases.hashicorp.com $(lsb_release -cs) main"
   sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install vagrant
   ```

5. Install *Packer* by executing the following commands. Find more on [the official website](https://www.packer.io/downloads).

   ```shell
   curl -fsSL https://apt.releases.hashicorp.com/gpg | sudo apt-key add -
   sudo apt-add-repository "deb [arch=amd64] https://apt.releases.hashicorp.com $(lsb_release -cs) main"
   sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install packer
   ```

6. Install *Ansible* by the following commands. Find more on [the official documentation](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html).

   ```shell
   pip3 install ansible
   ```

   Alternatively:

   ```shell
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install software-properties-common
   sudo add-apt-repository --yes --update ppa:ansible/ansible
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install ansible
   ```

7. Install `pywinrm` by the following command.

   ```shell
   pip3 install pywinrm
   ```

8. Install `sshpass` to allow *Ansible* to use password login by the following command.

   ```shell
   sudo apt install sshpass
   ```

9. To avoid a bug with *Ansible*, set an environment variable by the following command. Find more [here](https://github.com/clong/DetectionLab/issues/543).

   ```shell
   echo 'export OBJC_DISABLE_INITIALIZE_FORK_SAFETY=YES' >> ~/.bashrc
   ```

10. Install `ovftool`. Open a web browser and download [ovftool](https://developer.vmware.com/web/tool/4.4.0/ovf). Unzip the downloaded file and add its path to your `PATH` environment variable by the following commands. Find more on [the official website](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Telco-Cloud-Operations/1.4.0/deployment-guide-140/GUID-95301A42-F6F6-4BA9-B3A0-A86A268754B6.html).

    ```shell
    unzip <YOUR DOWNLOADED FILE>
    echo 'export PATH="$PATH:<PATH TO YOUR UNZIPPED FOLDER>"' >> ~/.bashrc
    ```

#### ESXi Environment Configurations

Note that all the commands in this subsection should be executed on the **ESXi** machine. Find more in the Software section of [this tutorial](https://clo.ng/blog/detectionlab-on-esxi/) and the instructions [here](https://nickcharlton.net/posts/using-packer-esxi-6.html).

1. Navigate to `https://<YOUR ESXi IP ADDRESS>/ui/#/host/manage/services` and set the policy for SSH to *start and stop with host*, and be sure to manually start the service as well.

2. The ESXi instance must have at least two separate networks - a network accessible from your current machine with internet connectivity and a hostonly network to allow the VMs to communicate over a private network. The network that provides DHCP and internet connectivity must also be reachable from the host that is running *Terraform* - ensure your firewall is configured to allow this. Below are some references.

   ![vSwitch](./img/DetectionLab/ESXi_vSwitch.jpg)

   ![Network](./img/DetectionLab/ESXi_Network.jpg)

3. Allow *Packer* to infer the guest IP from ESXi without the VM needing to report it itself by the following command.

   ```shell
   esxcli system settings advanced set -o /Net/GuestIPHack -i 1
   ```

4. Open VNC ports on the firewall. Either configure it **temporarily** following the instructions [here](https://nickcharlton.net/posts/using-packer-esxi-6.html) or **permanently** [here](https://github.com/sukster/ESXi-Packer-VNC). Find more on [official article 1](https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/2008226) and [official article 2](https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/2043564).

   **Permanently**:

   1. Ensure that the Acceptance Level in ESXi is set to "Community" by going to Manage -> Security & Users -> Acceptance Level or the following command.

      ```shell
      esxcli software acceptance set --level=CommunitySupported
      ```

   2. Upload the VIB file to `/vmfs/volumes/datastore1/tmp` directory of the ESXi server

   3. Login to ESXi via SSH and execute the following command.

      ```shell
      esxcli software vib install -v /vmfs/volumes/datastore1/tmp/packer-vnc.vib -f
      ```

   4. Verify using the following commands.

      ```shell
      esxcli software vib list | grep 'vnc'
      esxcli network firewall ruleset list | grep 'vnc'
      ```

### Building and Deploying

After all the prerequisites are satisfied, do the following. Note that all the commands in this subsection should be executed on the **Ubuntu** machine.

#### Clone the Repo

Clone the repository to your workspace by `git clone git@github.com:eWalker-TestLab/TestLab.git`.

#### Packer Build

1. Edit `DetectionLab/ESXi/Packer/variables.json` to match your ESXi configuration. The `esxi_network_with_dhcp_and_internet` variable refers to any ESXi network that will be able to provide DHCP and internet access to the VM while itâ€™s being built in *Packer*. This is usually *VM Network*. The file should be similar to the following. Find more [here](https://detectionlab.network/deployment/esxi/#steps).

   ![variables.json](img/DetectionLab/variables.json.png)

2. Since ESXi 6.7 is used, delete the following code snippets from `DetectionLab/ESXi/Packer/windows_10_esxi.json`, `DetectionLab/ESXi/Packer/windows_2016_esxi.json`, and `DetectionLab/ESXi/Packer/ubuntu2004_esxi.json`. Find more [here](https://detectionlab.network/deployment/esxi/#special-configuration-for-esxi-6x).

   ```json
   "vnc_over_websocket": true,
   "insecure_connection": true,
   ```

3. Execute the following commands from the `DetectionLab/ESXi/Packer` directory.

   ```shell
   PACKER_CACHE_DIR=../../Packer/packer_cache packer build -var-file variables.json windows_10_esxi.json
   PACKER_CACHE_DIR=../../Packer/packer_cache packer build -var-file variables.json windows_2016_esxi.json
   PACKER_CACHE_DIR=../../Packer/packer_cache packer build -var-file variables.json ubuntu2004_esxi.json
   PACKER_CACHE_DIR=../../Packer/packer_cache packer build -var-file variables.json kali2022_esxi.json
   ```

   **NOTE**: Outputting *Packer* debug information is highly recommended. To do so, use the following commands instead of the above build commands. Find more on [the official website](https://www.packer.io/docs/debugging).

   ```shell
   PACKER_CACHE_DIR=../../Packer/packer_cache PACKER_LOG=1 packer build -var-file variables.json windows_10_esxi.json &> logs/packer_build_win10.log
   PACKER_CACHE_DIR=../../Packer/packer_cache PACKER_LOG=1 packer build -var-file variables.json windows_2016_esxi.json &> logs/packer_build_winserver2016.log
   PACKER_CACHE_DIR=../../Packer/packer_cache PACKER_LOG=1 packer build -var-file variables.json ubuntu2004_esxi.json &> logs/packer_build_ubuntu20.log
   PACKER_CACHE_DIR=../../Packer/packer_cache PACKER_LOG=1 packer build -var-file variables.json kali2022_esxi.json &> logs/packer_build_kali.log
   ```

   To view the log files in real-time, use `tail -f <PATH TO YOUR LOG FILE>`.

4. After *Packer* finishes building, verify that you now see `Windows10`, `WindowsServer2016`, `Ubuntu2004`, and `Kali2022` in the ESXi console.

#### Terraform Build

1. In `DetectionLab/ESXi`, Create a `terraform.tfvars` file to override the default variables listed in `variables.tf`. **DO examine the `varibales.tf` file to determine the values of variables that match your environment needs!** The file should be similar to the following.

   ![terraform.tfvars](img/DetectionLab/terraform.tfvars.png)

2. In `DetectionLab/ESXi`, execute the following commands.

   ```shell
   terraform init
   terraform apply -auto-approve
   ```

   **NOTE**: Outputting *Terraform* debug information is highly recommended. To do so, use the following commands instead of the above build commands. Find more on [the official website](https://www.terraform.io/internals/debugging).

   ```shell
   TF_LOG=DEBUG terraform init &> logs/terraform_init_0.log
   TF_LOG=DEBUG terraform apply -auto-approve &> logs/terraform_apply_0.log
   ```

3. After *Terraform* finishes building, change the working directory to `DetectionLab/ESXi/ansible`.

#### Ansible Playbook

1. Edit `DetectionLab/ESXi/ansible/inventory.yml` and replace the IP Addresses with the respective IP Addresses of your corresponding ESXi VMs. The file should be similar to the following.

   ![inventory.yml](img/DetectionLab/inventory.yml.png)

   **NOTE**: Change mac addresses in `main.yml` under `ESXi/ansible/roles/<dc/logger/wef/win10>/tasks/` to match the mac address in `DetectionLab/ESXi/variables.tf` if you changed earlier.

2. Take snapshots of all of the VMs. Make sure to unlock all the VMs to prevent connection problems. Then run the following command.

   ```shell
   ansible-playbook -v detectionlab.yml
   ```

   **NOTE**: Outputting *Ansible* debug information is highly recommended. To do so, use the following commands instead of the above build commands. Find more by `ansible --help` command.

   ```shell
   ansible-playbook -vvvv detectionlab.yml --tags "logger" &> logs/ansible-playbook_logger.log
   ansible-playbook -vvvv detectionlab.yml --tags "dc" &> logs/ansible-playbook_dc.log
   ansible-playbook -vvvv detectionlab.yml --tags "wef" &> logs/ansible-playbook_wef.log
   ansible-playbook -vvvv detectionlab.yml --tags "win10" &> logs/ansible-playbook_win10.log
   ```

   After *Ansible* finishes building, you should see results similar to the following.

    ```log
    192.168.1.227              : ok=39   changed=24   unreachable=0    failed=0    skipped=0    rescued=0    ignored=0
    192.168.1.46               : ok=40   changed=20   unreachable=0    failed=0    skipped=2    rescued=0    ignored=0
    192.168.1.60               : ok=25   changed=16   unreachable=0    failed=0    skipped=0    rescued=0    ignored=0
    192.168.1.17               : ok=29   changed=21   unreachable=0    failed=0    skipped=0    rescued=0    ignored=0
    ```

#### Install and Deploy Wazuh (automatically)

After finishing building the **logger** with *Ansible*, Wazuh Server should be installed on the **logger** already. The credential is `admin:TestLab123?`.

#### Install and deploy opensearch and winlogbeat (automatically)

1. Move directory to `~/tool/`

2. Run the following commands on three teminals respectively to start opensearch service:

   ```shell
   ./opensearch/opensearch-tar-install.sh
   ./dashboard/bin/opensearch-dashboards
   ./logstash/bin/logstash -f ./logstash/testconf
   ```

3. Go to `<this.host.ip.address>:5601` with `admin:admin` to work on opensearch

4. further filter.conf files can add to `~/tool/logstash/testconf/`

#### Install and Deploy Wazuh (manually)

1. It is highly recommended to take snapshots of all of the VMs before installing Wazuh. Then, power off the **logger** VM and change its RAM to **at least 8GB**.

2. In the **logger** VM, add `User=root` to the `/usr/lib/systemd/system/fwupd-refresh.service` file. The file should be similar to the following. Find more [here](https://github.com/fwupd/fwupd/issues/3037).

   ![fwupd-refresh.service](img/DetectionLab/fwupd-refresh.service.jpg)

3. In the **logger** VM, execute the following command. Find more on [the official website](https://documentation.wazuh.com/current/quickstart.html#installing-wazuh).

   ```shell
   curl -sO https://packages.wazuh.com/4.3/wazuh-install.sh && sudo bash ./wazuh-install.sh -a
   ```

4. In the **dc**, **wef**, and **win10** VM, download the installer from [the official website](https://packages.wazuh.com/4.x/windows/wazuh-agent-4.3.5-1.msi). Then double click the downloaded file to install it. Find more on [the official website](https://documentation.wazuh.com/current/installation-guide/wazuh-agent/wazuh-agent-package-windows.html).

#### Install and deploy opensearch and winlogbeat (manually)

1. In agent VMs, download and unzip winlogbeat-oss from [website](https://www.elastic.co/downloads/beats/winlogbeat-oss).  Find more from [official document](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/winlogbeat/current/winlogbeat-installation-configuration.html).

2. Change current directory to winlogbeat folder. Open a PowerShell prompt as an Administrator. Run

   ```powershell
   .\install-service-winlogbeat.ps1
   ```

3. Configure `winlogbeat.yml` file as follows.

   - Use `Get-EventLog *` on PowerShell to get the list of available event logs. And put all entrices under `winlogbeat.event_logs:`. Find more [here](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/winlogbeat/current/configuration-winlogbeat-options.html#configuration-winlogbeat-options-event_logs-name)

      ![Get-EventLog *](img/DetectionLab/get_eventlog.jpg)

      ![winlogbeat_config](img/DetectionLab/winlogbeat_config_1.jpg)

   - Configure winlogbeat to output all logs to logstash on **logger**

      ![winlogbeat_config](img/DetectionLab/winlogbeat_config_2.jpg)

4. Run

   ```powershell
   .\winlogbeat.exe setup -e
   Start-Service winlogbeat
   ```

5. Move to **logger** vm. Download and unzip opensearch, opensearch dashboard, and logstash from [website](https://opensearch.org/downloads.html)

6. Refer to [here](http://192.168.68.198:7111/wiki/Falcon/Opensearch)

   ![opensearch install](img/DetectionLab/opensearch_install.jpg)

   Run command once to install necessary files:

   ```powershell
   ./opensearch/opensearch-tar-install.sh
   ```

7. Configure both opensearch and dashboard yml file under respective config folder similar to follow:

   ![opensearch config](img/DetectionLab/opensearch_config.jpg)

8. Create a `testconf` folder to store all the filter and conf files. Create a `test.conf` file inside the folder.

9. Edit the config file similar to the following to receive event logs from winlogbeat.

   ![logstash config](img/DetectionLab/logstash_config.jpg)

10. Run following commands on three teminal respectively to start the service:

    ```powershell
    ./opensearch/opensearch-tar-install.sh
    ./dashboard/bin/opensearch-dashboards
    ./logstash/bin/logstash -f ./logstash/testconf
    ```

11. Now you can go to `<this.host.ip.address>:5601` with `admin:admin` to work on opensearch.

## Things to Notice

### Prerequisites

- It is recommended to install setup the environment using *Linux* or *macOS*. *Windows* is not recommended because some of the tools, such as *Ansible*, cannot run on *Windows* according to the [official documentation](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/windows_faq.html#can-ansible-run-on-windows).

- It is recommended to check your system's proxy settings. Also, it is recommended not to use any proxy applications or browser plugins (e.g., *SwitchyOmega*) during the setup process.

### Building and Deploying

- When cloning the `TestLab` repo, **DO NOT** clone the repo to the local machine and then copy and paste the repo into your working virtual machine. This will cause some permission errors. Find more on [the official website](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/reference_appendices/config.html#avoiding-security-risks-with-ansible-cfg-in-the-current-directory).

- To rebuild a specific VM, run the following from `DetectionLab`/ESXi/`.

  ```shell
  terraform apply -replace="esxi_guest.<dc/logger/wef/win10>"
  ```

  Then go to `DetectionLab/ESXi/ansible/` and run

  ```shell
  ansible-playbook -v detectionlab.yml --tags "<dc/logger/wef/win10>"
  ```

- To restart the playbook at a specific task, use

  ```shell
  ansible-playbook -v detectionlab.yml --tags="<dc/logger/wef/win10>" --start-at-task="<taskname>"
  ```
