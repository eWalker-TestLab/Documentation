# ESXi 6.7 on NUC8i7BEH (with Ubuntu 20.04 in VMware Workstation Pro 16)

## Build Procedure

Although this setup is done using Ubuntu 20.04 guest OS in VMware, the same should apply to native OS running bare metal.

### Prerequisites

#### Ubuntu Environment Configurations

Note that **all the commands in this section should be executed on the Ubuntu machine**.

1. Before starting building the lab, updating the system is recommended. This can be done by executing `sudo apt update` and then `sudo apt full-upgrade -y`. Finally, `reboot` the machine.

2. Install necessary tools by executing the following command.

   ```shell
   sudo apt install build-essential curl git pip3 gnupg software-properties-common
   ```

3. Install *Terraform* by executing the following commands. More info on [the official website](https://www.terraform.io/downloads).

   ```shell
   curl -fsSL https://apt.releases.hashicorp.com/gpg | sudo apt-key add -
   sudo apt-add-repository "deb [arch=amd64] https://apt.releases.hashicorp.com $(lsb_release -cs) main"
   sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install terraform
   ```

4. Install *Vagrant* by executing the following commands. More info on [the official website](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads).

   ```shell
   curl -fsSL https://apt.releases.hashicorp.com/gpg | sudo apt-key add -
   sudo apt-add-repository "deb [arch=amd64] https://apt.releases.hashicorp.com $(lsb_release -cs) main"
   sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install vagrant
   ```

5. Install *Packer* by executing the following commands. More info on [the official website](https://www.packer.io/downloads).

   ```shell
   curl -fsSL https://apt.releases.hashicorp.com/gpg | sudo apt-key add -
   sudo apt-add-repository "deb [arch=amd64] https://apt.releases.hashicorp.com $(lsb_release -cs) main"
   sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install packer
   ```

6. Install *Ansible* using the following commands. More info on [the official documentation](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html).

   ```shell
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install software-properties-common
   sudo add-apt-repository --yes --update ppa:ansible/ansible
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install ansible
   ```

7. Install `pywinrm` using the following command.

   ```shell
   pip3 install pywinrm
   ```

8. Install `sshpass` to allow *Ansible* to use password login by the following command.

   ```shell
   sudo apt install sshpass
   ```

9. To avoid a bug with *Ansible*, set an environment variable using the following command.

   ```shell
   echo 'export OBJC_DISABLE_INITIALIZE_FORK_SAFETY=YES' >> ~/.bash_profile
   ```

10. Install `ovftool`. In Ubuntu, open a web browser and download [ovftool](https://developer.vmware.com/web/tool/4.4.0/ovf). Unzip the downloaded file and add its path to your `PATH` environment variable by the following commands. More info [here](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Telco-Cloud-Operations/1.4.0/deployment-guide-140/GUID-95301A42-F6F6-4BA9-B3A0-A86A268754B6.html).

    ```shell
    unzip <YOUR DOWNLOADED FILE>
    echo 'export PATH="$PATH:<PATH TO YOUR UNZIPPED FOLDER>"' >> ~/.bash_profile
    ```

#### ESXi Environment Configurations

Note that **all the commands in this section should be executed on the ESXi machine**.

Refer to the instructions [here](https://clo.ng/blog/detectionlab-on-esxi/) in the Software section and also the instructions [here](https://nickcharlton.net/posts/using-packer-esxi-6.html). The following steps should be executed on the ESXi machine.

1. The ESXi instance must have at least two separate networks - one that is accessible from your current machine and has internet connectivity and a HostOnly network to allow the VMs to communicate over a private network. The network that provides DHCP and internet connectivity must also be reachable from the host that is running *Terraform* - ensure your firewall is configured to allow this. Below are some references.

   ![Network](./img/DetectionLab/ESXi_Network.jpg)

2. Allow *Packer* to infer the guest IP from ESXi without the VM needing to report it itself by the following command.

   ```shell
   esxcli system settings advanced set -o /Net/GuestIPHack -i 1
   ```

3. Open VNC ports on the firewall. You can either configure it **temporarily** following the instructions [here](https://nickcharlton.net/posts/using-packer-esxi-6.html) or **permanently** [here](https://github.com/sukster/ESXi-Packer-VNC). More info on the [official article 1](https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/2008226) and [official article 2](https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/2043564). You can check it by the following command.

   ```shell
   esxcli network firewall ruleset list | grep vnc
   ```

### Building and Deploying

#### Build and Deploy DetectionLab

After all the prerequisites are satisfied, do the following. Note that **all the commands in this section should be executed on the Ubuntu machine**.

1. Clone the repository to your workspace by `git clone git@github.com:eWalker-TestLab/TestLab.git`.

2. Edit `DetectionLab/ESXi/Packer/variables.json` to match your ESXi configuration. The `esxi_network_with_dhcp_and_internet` variable refers to any ESXi network that will be able to provide DHCP and internet access to the VM while itâ€™s being built in *Packer*. This is usually VM Network. The file should be similar to the following. More info [here](https://detectionlab.network/deployment/esxi/#steps).

   ![variables.json](img/DetectionLab/variables.json.jpg)

3. Since ESXi 6.7 is used, edit `DetectionLab/ESXi/Packer/windows_10_esxi.json`, `DetectionLab/ESXi/Packer/windows_2016_esxi.json` and `DetectionLab/ESXi/Packer/ubuntu2004_esxi.json` as described [here](https://detectionlab.network/deployment/esxi/#special-configuration-for-esxi-6x).

4. Execute the following commands from the `DetectionLab/ESXi/Packer` directory.

   ```shell
   PACKER_CACHE_DIR=../../Packer/packer_cache packer build -var-file variables.json windows_10_esxi.json
   PACKER_CACHE_DIR=../../Packer/packer_cache packer build -var-file variables.json windows_2016_esxi.json
   PACKER_CACHE_DIR=../../Packer/packer_cache packer build -var-file variables.json ubuntu2004_esxi.json
   ```

   After *Packer* build finish, verify that you now see `Windows10`, `WindowsServer2016`, and `Ubuntu2004` in the ESXi console.

5. In `DetectionLab/ESXi`, Create a `terraform.tfvars` file to override the default variables listed in `variables.tf`. The file should be similar to the following.

   ![terraform.tfvars](img/DetectionLab/terraform.tfvars.jpg)

6. In `DetectionLab/ESXi`, execute the following commands.

   ```shell
   terraform init
   terraform apply
   ```

7. After *Terraform* build finish, change the working directory to `DetectionLab/ESXi/ansible`.

8. Edit `DetectionLab/ESXi/ansible/inventory.yml` and replace the IP Addresses with the respective IP Addresses of your corresponding ESXi VMs. The file should be similar to the following.

   ![inventory.yml](img/DetectionLab/inventory.yml.jpg)

9. Take snapshots of all of the VMs. Then run the following command.

   ```shell
   ansible-playbook -v detectionlab.yml
   ```

10. After *Ansible* build finish, you should see results similar to the following.

    ```log
    192.168.1.227              : ok=39   changed=24   unreachable=0    failed=0    skipped=0    rescued=0    ignored=0
    192.168.1.46               : ok=40   changed=20   unreachable=0    failed=0    skipped=2    rescued=0    ignored=0
    192.168.1.60               : ok=25   changed=16   unreachable=0    failed=0    skipped=0    rescued=0    ignored=0
    192.168.1.17               : ok=29   changed=21   unreachable=0    failed=0    skipped=0    rescued=0    ignored=0
    ```

#### Install and Deploy Wazuh (manually)

1. It is highly recommended to take snapshots of all of the VMs before installing Wazuh. Then, power off the **logger** VM and change its RAM to **at least 8GB**.

2. In the **logger** VM, add `User=root` to the `/usr/lib/systemd/system/fwupd-refresh.service` file. The file should be similar to the following. More info [here](https://github.com/fwupd/fwupd/issues/3037).

   ![fwupd-refresh.service](img/DetectionLab/fwupd-refresh.service.jpg)

3. In the **logger** VM, execute the following command. More info on [the official website](https://documentation.wazuh.com/current/quickstart.html#installing-wazuh).

   ```shell
   curl -sO https://packages.wazuh.com/4.3/wazuh-install.sh && sudo bash ./wazuh-install.sh -a
   ```

4. In the **dc**, **wef**, and **win10** VM, download the installer from [the official website](https://packages.wazuh.com/4.x/windows/wazuh-agent-4.3.5-1.msi). Then double click the downloaded file to install it. More info on [the official website](https://documentation.wazuh.com/current/installation-guide/wazuh-agent/wazuh-agent-package-windows.html).

## Things to Notice

### Prerequisites

- It is recommended to install setup the environment using *Linux* or *macOS*. *Windows* is not recommended because some of the tools, such as *Ansible*, cannot run on *Windows* according to the [official documentation](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/windows_faq.html#can-ansible-run-on-windows).

- It is recommended to check your system's proxy settings. Also, it is recommended not to use any proxy applications or browser plugins (e.g., *SwitchyOmega*) during the setup process.

### Building and Deploying

- Outputting *Packer* debug information is highly recommended. To do so, use the following commands instead of the original build commands. More info on the [official website](https://www.packer.io/docs/debugging).

  ```shell
  PACKER_CACHE_DIR=../../Packer/packer_cache PACKER_LOG=1 packer build -var-file variables.json windows_10_esxi.json &> logs/packer_build_win10.log
  PACKER_CACHE_DIR=../../Packer/packer_cache PACKER_LOG=1 packer build -var-file variables.json windows_2016_esxi.json &> logs/packer_build_winserver2016.log
  PACKER_CACHE_DIR=../../Packer/packer_cache PACKER_LOG=1 packer build -var-file variables.json ubuntu2004_esxi.json &> logs/packer_build_ubuntu20.log
  ```

  To view the log files in real-time, use the following command.

  ```shell
  tail -f <PATH TO YOUR LOG FILE>
  ```

- Outputting *Terraform* debug information is highly recommended. To do so, use the following commands instead of the original build commands. More info on the [official website](https://www.terraform.io/internals/debugging).

  ```shell
  TF_LOG=DEBUG terraform init &> logs/terraform_init_0.log
  TF_LOG=DEBUG terraform apply &> logs/terraform_apply_0.log
  ```

- Outputting *Ansible* debug information is highly recommended. To do so, use the following commands instead of the original build commands. More info by `ansible --help` command.

  ```shell
  ansible-playbook -vvv detectionlab.yml --tags "logger" &> logs/ansible-playbook_logger.log
  ansible-playbook -vvv detectionlab.yml --tags "dc" &> logs/ansible-playbook_dc.log
  ansible-playbook -vvv detectionlab.yml --tags "wef" &> logs/ansible-playbook_wef.log
  ansible-playbook -vvv detectionlab.yml --tags "win10" &> logs/ansible-playbook_win10.log
  ```
